This is a small project by Yang Zetian, now a undergraduate in BUAA, Beijing, China.

Since the second half year 2011, I have been working in the [jliulab][] in BNU.
That give me a chance to use Linux substantially, and I'm more and more
interested to it.  As a Linux beginner, I have been confronted with a lot of problems
while working with it.  Some of these problems I solved and got a lot of fun, but some
of them I didn't.

As my memory isn't very good, I start thinking of making
records of these problems so that I needn't begin from scratch when coming
across them again.  Incidentally, I got to know that Github can be used as a
free blog server.  That's what I need exactly, so everything begins...
